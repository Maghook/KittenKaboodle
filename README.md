My first Unity game as a student of game design and digital media at TAFE. Main source of learning how to write code was from tutorials and reading through the Unity documentation. Thanks to Sebastian Lague and N3K EN for providing some great (and usually easy to understand) YouTube tutorials. Sorry to all the people whose art I "borrowed" but my teacher preferred that I provide more than just a simple white box for every meaningful game object.

This was fun. I think I enjoy coding. I know I enjoy solving puzzles, so I guess this is simply the next step. Going through this process for the first time has inspired me to study a Bachelor's of Computer Science at university in 2017. I'll have to do distance education though, I live too far away from anywhere that offers the course. I hope it goes well. I'd like to learn more to benefit game/app development and automation.

Guess we'll find out soon if it all goes to plan as I'd like to continue working on this game, I think it's a cute and fun idea. Maybe not as another 2D platformer though...
